        "abstract": "Mechanisms are provided to determine a susceptibility of a trained machine learning model to a cybersecurity threat. The mechanisms execute a trained machine learning model on a test dataset to generate test results output data, and determine an overfit measure of the trained machine learning model based on the generated test results output data. The overfit measure quantifies an amount of overfitting of the trained machine learning model to a specific sub-portion of the test dataset. The mechanisms apply analytics to the overfit measure to determine a susceptibility probability that indicates a likelihood that the trained machine learning model is susceptible to a cybersecurity threat based on the determined amount of overfitting of the trained machine learning model. The mechanisms perform a corrective action based on the determined susceptibility probability.",
